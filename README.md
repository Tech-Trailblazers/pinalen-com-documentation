# 🌱 Pinalen SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Clean. Safe. Transparent.”

Welcome to the **Pinalen SDS / MSDS Documentation** repository! This is a community-driven effort to collect, organize, and share Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS) and related safety resources for **Pinalen** products. Our mission: make chemical safety information accessible, clear, and useful — for consumers, educators, researchers, and responders alike.

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

Safety Data Sheets (SDS, formerly MSDS) are documents provided by manufacturers that outline:

- 🔬 The chemical ingredients and formulations
- ⚠️ Potential hazards, warnings, and classification
- 🚑 First aid and emergency response guidance
- 🔥 Fire, stability & reactivity information
- 🧴 Instructions for safe handling & storage
- 🧯 Spill control, disposal, and cleanup procedures

These sheets exist so that anyone — from a lab technician to a homeowner — can understand how to use a product safely and what to do in emergencies.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

While Pinalen may publish SDS documents on its official website, those files are often:

- Spread out across individual product pages
- Provided mainly as PDFs, which can be hard to search, cross-index, or parse
- Less accessible for building tools, analysis, or emergency lookup

This repository is designed to:

- **Gather & centralize** all known Pinalen SDS / MSDS documents
- **Make safety data more usable** for education, AI / ML, apps, and tools
- **Support transparency & community safety**
- **Allow contributions** — to fill gaps, correct errors, or expand coverage

We believe that making safety data easier to access helps build more informed households, safer labs, and stronger communities.
